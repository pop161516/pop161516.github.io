        The colours popped out at me immediately! Using such a vibrant hue that
        covered most of the page was incredibly engaging. After the colour, I
        noticed some of the interaction, specifically the text following my
        mouse asking me to click for sound.

        I started by clicking to allow sound then I spent most of the two
        minutes playing with the mouse position, using the text brush and moving
        typography. When I eventually moved on, I spent the rest of the time
        watching the videos included at the beginning of chapter one. It was
        only after about 5 minutes that I got to the writing.

          I think this page was created to educate people. It describes itself
          as a story and I think it does a good job by providing the reader with
          chapters and plenty of narrative along with image and video media. It
          showcases the history, process, and legacy of Frank Gehry.

          This site is accessible for reuse and rereading. Like any educational
          text, readers may only need to browse once but the content is laid out
          in chapters in case you need to find points or navigate. It has plenty
          of content that you may want to re-read and makes it entertaining to
          revisit.

          <span class="question">
            How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
            interacted with over time?</span
          >
          <br />
          The interactivity is focused at the beginning and end of the
          experience. This may indicate that the experience is designed to be
          replayed from start to end.  The interactivity begins less
          functionally and more aesthetically with things like mouse tracking
          and scroll-based navigation. But during the middle (making up a
          majority of the journey) there is little interaction besides parallax
          scrolling and video clips. The designers may have minimalised the
          interaction to encourage views to focus on content rather than style
          during the reading portion.

          >
          <br />
          The parallax scrolling and stretchy text were an interactive way of
          encouraging users to continue scrolling. It also maintains a similar
          style to a pop-up or interactive children’s book. This reinforces the
          aesthetic of a story and the goal of education. In the chapter
          portions of the site, the typography and its style in terms of colour
          and layout are similar to a news article. Very legible text with space
          for readability and images. Interactivity is used to emphasise
          creativity and engage readers in a story that might otherwise be long
          or un-interesting.

        <br />
        Minor details like the music looping or cutting out between chapters
        broke the immersion of the journey. The layout of the text and the use
        of padding and margins mean the type was heavily squished requiring
        readers to jump lines frequently and resulting in the site being
        excessively long. “Read more” boxes couldn’t be shrunk again making the
        page more difficult to navigate.

        <br />
        The beginning page with the interactive text and drawings was fun and
        engaging. Very re-playable and creative. The parallax chapters broke up
        the story well and made the site easier to digest.
